== DESCRIPTION:

Some smaller jQuery plugins I've written suitable for copying and pasting into
projects. These are largely unsupported.

Currently includes:

* Input hints
* Auto-growing text area
* CSS-based page text resizing with cookie storage
* Rollovers with preloading
* DOM-builder
* Text effects
* unselectable - disables text selection
* linify - wraps each line of an element's text in its own tag
