    <h3>How much does Sayygo cost?</h3>
    <p>Sayygo is completely FREE! No costs, no surprises.</p>
    <h3>What’s a Sayygo?</h3>
    <p>A Sayygo is a statement of intent to do something fun with someone else. You “pop” a Sayygo, and if others are
    listening for it, they (and you) get a “hit.” Either of you can begin a dialog with the other if you want, or do
    nothing, it’s all up to you because you’re in control of how you want to “play” your Sayygos.</p>
    <h3>What’s a Bucket List?</h3>
    <p>A Bucket List is a collection of things you want to do before you “kick the bucket,” which is an English euphemism
    that means “to die.”</p>
    <h3>What’s the relationship between a Bucket List and a Sayygo?</h3>
    <p>Any item on a Bucket List can be converted to a Sayygo when you want to actively announce (pop) it. This alerts
    listeners that you’re ready for your next adventure.</p>
    <h3>How did Sayygo get started?</h3>
    <p>Sayygo was created for people who have always wanted to do something fun or adventurous but had no one to do it
    with. Now there’s an easy and safe was to connect with others who want to do the same thing. What happens next
    is up to YOU!</p>
